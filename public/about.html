                            <p>Welcome to <em>lilycove-xx.neocities.org!</em> This is a website born of my desire to improve my website coding (for other projects I have in mind)
                                as well as to try and participate in the culture of the old Internet. It is not an ambitious thing by any means and, frankly, could use some more polish,
                                but for an amateur I'd say it looks pretty good!
                            </div>
                            <div class="center-box">
                                <h2 class="main-title">webmaster</h2>
                                <p>Hi! I'm Annie. You may know me from various sites where I go by the pen name <em>@namilait</em>; if that is the case, I'm grateful to see you here!
                                    If not, well, nice to meet you, and I hope what I make can brighten your day, even if just a little.
                                <p>I am a young adult from Romania, but I have lived for good part of my childhood in Italy. I've played videogames as long as I remember, and I have drawn stuff for an equal amount of time.
                                    Not that I have taken the latter seriously until much later, but that's superfluous details!
                                </p>
                                <p>Here's some of my history with tech! I have fiddled with computers ever since I was a 'wee lad', although that mostly consisted of playing with the Office Suite and Paint, as well as browser games. I had an editing phase a few years back,
                                    and I have a passing familiarity with a couple coding languages, including HTML and CSS. No Javascript, I still have to learn it. I'd say that compared to my peers, I'm doing pretty good! (Plus, I know how to sail the seven seas!)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Well, there's nothing much else I need to say... I'd just like to thank you for checking out my little side of the Internet. 
                                </p>
                                </div>
